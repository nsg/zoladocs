These documentation pages are still a work in progress, I document and build the site as I go and expect things to move around. I use this documentation as a way to test and figure out the layout as well.

## Diretory structure

The base directory is `content` like any other Zola site.

```
content/_index.md
```

The start page / landing page is mostly generated from the documentations structure. This file contains a few manually specified values.
